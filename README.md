This is a rushed mod made for a small event with friends, there is likely a good amount of code made by ChatGPT or brought over from Mcreator to hold the event on time.

This breaks my usual code of:
- Only ask GPT for help on each thing once, if I've asked before I must refer to a previous project
- No code is allowed to be copy-pasted, anything referenced must be hand-rewritten to ensure understanding
